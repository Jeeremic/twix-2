                        <p>The responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's structure. 
                            They can be far-reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration. 
                            Typically, responsibilities include being a decision maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. 
                            The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and the rest of the outside world, as well as to the organization's management and employees; 
                            the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy.
                            As an executive officer of the company, the CEO reports the status of the business to the board of directors, motivates employees, 
                            and drives change within the organization. As a manager, the CEO presides over the organization's day-to-day operations.
                            The CEO is the person who is ultimately accountable for a company's business decisions, including those in operations, marketing, business development, 
                            finance, human resources, etc.
                            The CEO of a company is not necessarily the owner or the head of the company. The CEO of a political party is often entrusted with fundraising, 
                            particularly for election campaigns.</p>

                        <p>The term chief financial officer (CFO) refers to a senior executive responsible for managing the financial actions of a company. 
                            The CFO's duties include tracking cash flow and financial planning as well as analyzing the company's financial strengths 
                            and weaknesses and proposing corrective actions. The role of a CFO is similar to a treasurer or controller because they are responsible for managing 
                            the finance and accounting divisions and for ensuring that the companyâ€™s financial reports are accurate and completed in a timely manner.</p>

                            is an executive-level position in a company or other entity whose occupation is focused on the scientific and technological issues within an organization. 
                            A CTO is very similar to a chief information officer (CIO). CTOs will make decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align
                            with the organization's goals, while CIOs work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations. 
                            A CTO should be aware of new and existing technologies to guide the company's future endeavors. The attributes of the roles a CTO holds vary from one company 
                            to the next, mainly depending on their organizational structure.
